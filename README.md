# One Dot

A little app made during Creative Coding on Nov. 8, 2023, which is also in
preparation for a React Native session the following week.

## Set Up

This app is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

```
> npx create-expo-app app
```

The command will create an `app` directory.

## Running the App Locally

You can open the app in multiple ways. If you have iOS simulator installed, you
can do `npm run ios`. Since Expo projects support web (via `react-native-web`),
you can also do `npm run web` to have a local web server.
